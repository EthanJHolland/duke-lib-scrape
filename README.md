# duke-lib-scrape

An attempt to estimate the number of pages in the Duke library system by scraping data on a simple random sample of 10,000 books. Written in python using beautiful soup and multithreading.

Project abandoned because some wonderful people in the Metadata and Discovery Department of the Duke library system with access to the actual database helped me.

The answer: approximately 1,736,260,433 print pages as of summer 2017
For reference, if every single member of the ~20,000 Duke undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty (excluding medical school) read continuously at a rate of 1 page per minute, it would take 2 months to read through the the print library system. This of course does not include electronic resources.
